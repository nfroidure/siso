## 1. Design Choices

I could have created a higher order function but I find
 out easier to add routes with a method instead of
 building an object to bind with a function, so `Siso` is
 a JavaScript class. Also abstracting routes index format
 gives field for a few optimizations.

You may wonder why there is no mention of HTTP methods.
 The fact is that this router is made to be generic and
 usable either in backend, frontend or whatever needing
 to deal with paths in some way. If you are to use `Siso`
 for routing in an HTTP server, you should create a `Siso`
 instance for each HTTP method you plan to support.

 `Siso` allows to organize the data in an optimized for
 search way. There are then some tradeoffs you should be
 aware of:

* fixed length: you cannot register paths with an
 undefined length. Things like `register(['v0', '*'])`
 where `*` means any number of nodes is not allowed.
* one parameter per node: if you want to create a route
 like `/coords/$lat-$lng` you'll have no way of retrieving
`lat` and `lng` values separately from `Siso`. You will just
 retrieve a string you'll have to parse by yourself. The
 reason behind that is to KISS. This is an edge case in APIs
 so i do not want it to slow down the router matching system.

## 2. Indexing with Maps in Maps

To optimize the search, the basic workflow is:
- find the root map with the given nodes lengths
- recursively find in the child maps for each nodes

[See in context](./src/index.js#L79-L84)



### 2.1. Indexing by Nodes Length

Routers nodes are indexed by their number of nodes
 for better performances. It saves as much string
 comparison/regexp matching as the distribution of the
 paths lengths.

[See in context](./src/index.js#L92-L98)



### 2.2. Indexing each Nodes

A node can be a string, if so, we just use it as a key.
 Otherwise, it is a parameter with some regular expressions
 to match it, if so, there are some additionnal work.

To ensure parameters unicity we maintain a map of every
 parameters in the `_parameters` property. Also since
 parameters needs some regular expression mathing work,
 we cannot just retrieve it by key. They are then put in
 a set with the `PARAMETER_NODES` special property.

[See in context](./src/index.js#L107-L118)



### 2.3. Enum or pattern

Declaring an `enum` or a `pattern` property is mandatory
 to properly registering a node.

I choosen to allow no implicit wildcard an instead require
 to do it explicitly since it is an unfrequent pattern
 while designing REST APIs. Mot of the time you know what
 your node will contain and filtering it is the best option.

## 3. Search workflow

To optimize nodes search, the basic workflow is:
- find a map with nodes lengths
